# <h1> Aqua - The open-source semi Desktop assistant </h1>
   Aqua is currently in Alpha stages and is still yet being developed.
   Aqua is currently only tested on Ubuntu and Mac OS, but should work with most Debian based operating systems.
   Note: AquaAI is not YET a true assistant yet.


# <h2> Using Aqua on Linux: </h2> 

```shell
mkdir Aqua ; cd Aqua
git clone https://github.com/NerdOfLinux/AquaAI.git 
cd Aqua-cpp; make  
```
# <h2> Using Aqua on Windows: </h2>
  Please note that we the developers are no longer officially supporting windows. If you are on Windows though please install and or use a adaquate C++ compiler, then run the Aqua.cpp File. Some features may not work as they require and take advantage of the linux shell.
 
 
# <h2> News: </h2> <br>
   3/1/2017 --> Python is once again being developed on and built!
   11/8/2017 --> Production is halted due to other coding interests. The current build should still functions properly though

#We currently do not have time to actively add features to Aqua. By all means Fork us and create new pull requests.
